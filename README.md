# Matplotlib and pyplot

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).

# About The Assignment

Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a bar plot showing frequency distribution of characters in the passage using the dictionary provided.
2. Generate a random sequence of 5 integers and use scatter and plot to plot against the number's index position.
3. Update the style of the scatter and plot from the task above.
4. Plot the tim eit takes to execute a sorting algorithm on a list based on the variables provided.

All of these tasks require your plots to have an appropriate title and labeled axes. Use the Matplotlib documentation as necessary to guide you through these exercises.

Do not use other external modules except `matplotlib` and `pyplot` (e.g. `math`, etc) for this assignment unless you are explicitly instructed to, though you may use built in python functions (`min`, `max`, etc) as you wish.

# Getting Started

    1. Copy the base repository into your GitHub account by selecting the "Use this Template" button on GitHub and specifying yourself as the owner.  The base repository is available at: https://github.com/wmnlp-materials/pyplot/blob/master/pyplot.ipynbLinks to an external site.

    2. Clone YOUR new repo down to your machine.

# Rubric

Each question is worth two points:

- Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
- Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)
